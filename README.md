# ESTIMATING-THE-SHARPE-RATIO
This project aims to estimate the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of comparing the risk and return on multiple investments. 

This is a part of DataCamp's structured projects. The core aim of this project is estimating the Sharpe Ratio. Here we estimate the Sharpe Ratio of investment on Amazon and Facebook stocks using the S&P500 as benchmark.

My motivation for completing this project is to apply the knowledge of time-series I've gained so far and also explore the realm of applied finance while practising core data science modules in Python such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

In this project, I find that the Sharpe Ratio obtained was heavilily influenced by the mean. I hope to explore this further.
